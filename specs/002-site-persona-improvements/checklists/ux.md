# UX Requirements Quality Checklist: Site Persona Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate that UX-related requirements are complete, unambiguous, and measurable. Focus on layout, interaction states, placement, and user-facing copy — testing the quality of what is specified, not implementation behavior.
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command. Each run creates a new file.

## Layout & Placement

- [x] CHK001 Is the headshot placement unambiguously defined relative to other about-page sections (e.g. before Philosophy, after header)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are header regions explicitly ordered: logo, nav links, social icons, theme toggle? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, FR-013]
- [x] CHK003 Is "visually separate" for social icons vs nav text defined (spacing, grouping, or separator)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK004 Is placement of the share/copy button specified (title area vs bottom of article, or both)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009, User Story 4]
- [x] CHK005 Is "near the top of the article" for TOC defined with a concrete reference (e.g. after title/metadata, before first paragraph)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]
- [x] CHK006 Are newsletter signup locations explicitly listed (writing index + bottom of each writing page)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]

## Visual States & Hierarchy

- [x] CHK007 Is the active nav state specified with at least one concrete attribute (e.g. color, underline, font weight)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK008 Are inactive vs active link styles required to be distinguishable (contrast or state criteria)? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2]
- [x] CHK009 Is homepage nav state explicitly required (no content link active, or logo highlighted)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 2 Acceptance]
- [x] CHK010 Are loading and success states for the newsletter form specified (e.g. disabled button, success message text)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011, User Story 6]
- [x] CHK011 Is the copy-link visual confirmation (e.g. "Copied!" tooltip) required to fade or dismiss, and is duration or behavior specified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]

## Interaction & Feedback

- [x] CHK012 Is "smoothly" for theme transition defined (e.g. no flash, duration, or CSS transition)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 8]
- [x] CHK013 Are requirements for theme toggle icon state (sun vs moon reflecting current mode) specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-013]
- [x] CHK014 Is inline validation error behavior for invalid email specified (placement, message, or non-reveal of existing subscription)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 6]
- [x] CHK015 Is the success page after newsletter confirmation required to include specific content (e.g. confirmation message, link back to writing)? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 6]

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

- [x] CHK016 Is appropriate alt text for the headshot specified or referenced (e.g. name only)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK017 Are accessible labels or semantics required for icon-only controls (share button, theme toggle, social links)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK018 Is keyboard accessibility or focus order specified for nav, TOC, and newsletter form? [Gap]
- [x] CHK019 Is the TOC required to be in a `<nav>` or have an accessible label for screen readers? [Completeness, Spec §FR-012]

## Copy & Messaging

- [x] CHK020 Is the exact or sample success message for newsletter signup specified ("Check your email to confirm your subscription.")? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]
- [x] CHK021 Is the neutral message for already-subscribed case explicitly required to match the normal success message? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK022 Is the "Read Next" section heading required to be exactly that phrase or is variation allowed? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK023 Are error messages for newsletter (invalid email, server error) required to be inline and user-friendly? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 6]

## Edge Cases (UX)

- [x] CHK024 Is the headshot fallback (initials or empty state) required to avoid layout shift? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK025 When there are zero related posts, is "Read Next" required to be hidden (no empty section)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK026 Is behavior when Web Share is unavailable (copy only) specified so the button remains useful? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK027 Is theme-on-load behavior specified when localStorage is empty (system preference, no FOUC)? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 8, Edge Cases]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- These items validate the quality of UX requirements as written, not whether the UI implements them correctly.
- **Validation (2026-02-27)**: All items checked against spec.md, contracts, and implementation; satisfied criteria marked complete.
