**Purpose**: Validate that SEO and metadata requirements (Twitter Cards, JSON-LD, Open Graph) are complete, unambiguous, and verifiable. Tests the quality of what is specified, not implementation behavior.
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command. Each run creates a new file.

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- These items validate the quality of SEO/metadata requirements as written, not whether tags are correctly implemented.
