# Newsletter Requirements Quality Checklist: Site Persona Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate that newsletter and subscription requirements are complete, unambiguous, and consistent. Tests the quality of what is specified (flows, messaging, validation, edge cases), not implementation behavior.
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command. Each run creates a new file.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are the two signup locations (writing index page, bottom of each writing page) explicitly required and unambiguous? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK002 Is double opt-in (confirm via email before being added to audience) explicitly required in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the confirmation email content or template requirements specified (e.g. link, expiry mention)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 6]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the success page after confirmation required to show specific content (e.g. "You're subscribed", link back to writing)? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 6 Acceptance]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the dependency on Resend's audience/contacts API documented in requirements or assumptions? [Dependency, Spec §FR-011, Assumptions]

## Messaging & Copy

- [ ] CHK006 Is the post-submit success message specified (e.g. "Check your email to confirm your subscription.")? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, User Story 6]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the neutral message for already-subscribed case explicitly required to match normal success (no disclosure)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK008 Are inline validation error requirements for invalid email specified (placement, user-facing message)? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 6]
- [ ] CHK009 Are server or network error message requirements specified (e.g. generic retry message)? [Gap]

## Validation & Data

- [ ] CHK010 Is email validation scope defined (format only, or also disposable/domain rules)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK011 Is honeypot or bot protection mentioned in requirements or left to implementation? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 Is confirmation link expiry (e.g. 24 hours) specified in requirements or contracts? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for the flow: submit → confirmation email sent → user clicks link → added to audience → success page? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 6]
- [ ] CHK014 Are exception flows specified: invalid email (inline error), expired link (user-facing message), already subscribed (neutral message)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK015 Is behavior when Resend API is unavailable or returns error specified in requirements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK016 Is the "added to the audience" outcome defined (e.g. segment/contact in Resend)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK017 Can SC-008 ("newsletter signup successfully registers a subscription") be verified without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §SC-008]
- [ ] CHK018 Is "subscription is registered with the email service" in the Independent Test defined (e.g. contact in segment)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 6]

## Edge Cases

- [ ] CHK019 Is the already-subscribed edge case (neutral message, no disclosure) explicitly required? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Is re-submission after confirmation (same email, already in audience) behavior specified? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 Is behavior for duplicate pending confirmations (same email, two signups before confirming) specified? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- These items validate the quality of newsletter requirements as written, not whether the signup flow works in code.
