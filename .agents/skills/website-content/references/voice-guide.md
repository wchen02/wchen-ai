# Wilson Chen — Voice & Tone Guide

Voice profile distilled from existing site content (about page, writing entries, project narratives, homepage).

## Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Confident, not boastful | State convictions directly. No hedging, no self-deprecation. |
| Reflective, not academic | Think out loud. Share observations, not lectures. |
| Precise, not sterile | Every sentence earns its place. Cut filler ruthlessly. |
| Opinionated, not dismissive | Take positions. Acknowledge trade-offs without waffling. |
| Conversational gravity | Reads like a thoughtful person talking to a peer, not a brand. |

## Sentence Patterns

Wilson's writing follows these structural habits:

**Short declarative anchors followed by expansion:**
> "But physics still applies."
> "No matter how fast your edge function is, it will never beat the speed of serving a pre-compiled static file from a CDN."

**Rhetorical questions that reframe the problem:**
> "Yet, somehow, it feels like developers are still bogged down. Why?"
> "But what about dynamic data?"

**Italics for emphasis on key reframes:**
> "not just the prompt, but the *intent*, history, and surrounding constraints"
> "I fetch it *during the build process*"

**Contrasts that crystallize a position:**
> "The measure of a great product isn't how long someone uses it — it's how quickly they achieve what they set out to do."
> "Writing is how I stress-test ideas. Shipping is how I stress-test intuition."

**Dash-separated asides for conversational texture:**
> "primarily through AI agents that understand engineering context deeply enough to act on it"
> "building systems that help people spend less time in tools and more time in the work that matters to them"

## Vocabulary Preferences

### Use
- "build" / "ship" / "explore" / "believe" / "obsessed with"
- "friction" / "context" / "intention" / "execution" / "disappear"
- "compress the distance" / "knowledge fragmentation" / "context-aware"
- Active verbs: "I build," "I believe," "I chose," "We wanted"

### Avoid
- Corporate filler: "leverage," "synergy," "innovative," "cutting-edge"
- Hedging: "kind of," "sort of," "I think maybe"
- Hype language: "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive"
- Exclamation points
- Emojis in body copy

## Tone Calibration by Content Type

| Content Type | Tone | Example Register |
|---|---|---|
| Writing (essays) | Reflective, exploratory, opinionated | "I believe the next leap in developer productivity isn't a new abstraction layer." |
| Project narratives | Direct, motivated, specific | "I wanted to drastically reduce the time it takes for new engineers to understand a large codebase." |
| About page | Grounded, philosophical, personal | "The software worth building doesn't demand attention — it removes friction so quietly that people forget it's there." |
| Homepage hero | Concise, present-tense, forward-looking | "I am currently exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and developer tools." |
| Frontmatter (motivation, problem) | Punchy, first-person, problem-focused | "Note-taking apps become black holes where information goes to die." |

## First Person Usage

Always write in first person. Wilson owns every statement:
- "I build..." not "Wilson builds..."
- "I believe..." not "We believe..."
- Exception: project narratives may use "We" when referring to a team effort ("We built a custom ingestion pipeline...")

## Paragraph Length

- Body paragraphs: 1-3 sentences. Rarely 4+.
- Each paragraph advances exactly one idea.
- White space is a feature, not a gap.

## Section Headings

- Short, noun-phrase or imperative style
- Title case for H2: "Interests & Expertise," "Current Focus & Problems"
- Sentence case for H3 in content: "How it works," "The Vision"
- No trailing punctuation on headings
