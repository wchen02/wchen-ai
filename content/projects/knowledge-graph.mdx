motivation: "I read hundreds of articles and books, but rarely retain the actionable insights. I needed a way to query my own brain."
problemAddressed: "Note-taking apps become black holes where information goes to die. Organizing notes takes more time than using them."
learnings: "Automatic tagging using LLMs works surprisingly well. The key is strict schema enforcement before writing to the graph database."

This was a weekend experiment to connect my Obsidian vault to a local LLM.

## How it works

1. A cron job runs every night, scanning for modified markdown files.
2. It passes the content to a local model (Llama 3).
3. The model extracts entities and relationships.
4. Data is stored in Neo4j.

It allows me to ask questions like: *What have I read about distributed systems in the last year?*
