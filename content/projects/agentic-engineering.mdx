title: "Agentic Engineering Platform"
date: "2026-02-15T00:00:00Z"
status: "in-progress"
type: ["agent", "app"]
motivation: "I wanted to drastically reduce the time it takes for new engineers to understand a large codebase. Context loss is the biggest productivity killer."
problemAddressed: "When an engineer joins a team or switches to a new microservice, they spend weeks reading code. Existing tools just search code; they don't explain the 'why' behind architectural decisions."
learnings: "LLMs are great at summarization, but terrible at multi-step reasoning over scattered files. Building a graph-based context retriever significantly improved accuracy."

## The Vision

We wanted to build an agent that doesn't just read code, but understands the *system*.

Traditional code search tools rely on vector embeddings. They are great for finding "where is this function defined?", but fail completely at "why did we choose to use Redis here?"

## Architecture

We built a custom ingestion pipeline that parses ASTs, extracts comments, and maps them to Git commit messages to understand the evolution of the codebase.

```typescript
function ingestCodebase(repoPath: string) {
  // Parsing logic goes here
}
```

## Results

Early user testing showed a 40% reduction in time-to-first-PR for junior engineers using the tool.
