We've spent the last decade building better abstractions. React abstracted the DOM. Next.js abstracted routing and server-side rendering. Cloudflare abstracted infrastructure.

Yet, somehow, it feels like developers are still bogged down. Why?

Because while our abstractions got better, the *context required to use them* increased exponentially. 

To build a modern web application, you don't just need to know JavaScript. You need to know how the bundler interacts with the UI framework, how the state manager handles hydration, how the CI pipeline deploys to the edge, and how the database connection pool behaves in a serverless environment.

This is the friction between intention and execution.

When I have an idea ("I want to add a like button"), the execution involves touching five different files across three different layers of the stack, carefully managing the context of each.

I believe the next leap in developer productivity isn't a new abstraction layer. It's an intelligent agent that can hold that context for you. A tool that understands the *relationships* between your files, not just the text inside them.

If we can build tools that understand the system as a whole, we can finally get back to the pure joy of translating intention directly into reality.
